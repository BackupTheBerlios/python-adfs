ADFSlib and ADF2INF

Copyright (c) 2000-2003, David Boddie

This is a snapshot of my ADFS floppy disc reading library and its associated
utility.

The ADF2INF utility will take advantage of the cmdsyntax module if
available. See

    http://www.boddie.org.uk/david/Projects/Python/CMDSyntax

for details of how to obtain the cmdsyntax module.


Install ADFSlib and ADF2INF (as root) by typing

  python setup.py install

or just use them from the directory in which you unpack them.
